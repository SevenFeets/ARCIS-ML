tflite_info.py:
Purpose: Analyzes and displays detailed information about a TensorFlow Lite model
Key functions:
Shows model size, input/output details, tensor information
Tests the model with dummy input to verify it works
Reports quantization settings if present
Usage: python tflite_info.py --model path/to/model.tflite [--quantized]



inference_tflite.py:
Purpose: Performs object detection using a TensorFlow Lite model
Key functions:
Loads and processes images to the required format (320Ã—320)
Runs inference using the TFLite interpreter
Extracts bounding boxes and class probabilities
Filters results based on confidence threshold
Draws detection boxes on images and saves/displays results
Output: Annotated image with weapon detections (saved as detection_result_tflite.jpg)
Usage: python inference_tflite.py --image test.jpg --model model.tflite --threshold 0.3



test_inference.py:
Purpose: Similar to inference_tflite.py but uses the full Keras model (.h5) instead
Key differences:
Uses tf.keras.models.load_model instead of TFLite interpreter
Designed for desktop/server use rather than edge devices
Otherwise has similar image processing and output visualization functionality
Output: Annotated image with weapon detections (saved as detection_result.jpg)
Usage: python test_inference.py --image test.jpg --model model.h5 --threshold 0.3
